      <h2>Indian Classical Dance</h2>
      <div class="hobby">
        <img src="dance.JPG" ">

        <p>I developed a love for dancing at a young age when my parents
           enrolled me in a dance school to learn Bharatnatyam, an Indian classical dance form.
            Despite the occasional challenges, I thoroughly enjoyed attending classes and learning the art.
             Performing on stage was always a joy. 
             Each year, we were required to pass theory and practical exams,
              and after completing six years, I earned a senior diploma.
               While I have lost touch with regular practice since moving away from home,
                I find that returning to the studio for a few hours of practice is incredibly healing whenever I feel stressed.
                Despite living abroad, I continue to stay connected to my Indian roots by participating in cultural programs to showcase and share my heritage.

      <h2>Weight Training</h2>
      <div class="hobby">        
        
        <img src="gym.jpeg">
        <p>Going to the gym has become a significant part of my routine,
           not just for physical health but also for mental well-being. 
           It's amazing how a good workout can uplift your mood and reduce stress.
            I've learned a lot about fitness and nutrition along the way, 
            and I'm always looking for ways to improve my workouts and diet
             to reach my goals. The gym has become my sanctuary, a place where I can push myself,
              clear my mind, and focus on becoming the best version of myself.
              I have structured my workout routine into four days, focusing on
               different muscle groups each day. This approach allows me to target
                specific areas effectively while giving ample time for rest and recovery.</p>

      <h2>Travelling</h2>
      <div class="hobby"> 
        <img src="trip.jpeg" alt="Travelling">
        <p>I have a passion for traveling and exploring the open road, especially in the USA.
           I absolutely love the freedom and adventure that comes with driving. 
           My most recent adventure took me to Yellowstone National Park, where 
           I was captivated by the stunning landscapes and natural beauty. 
           For my next journey, I am planning a trip to Utah to visit Zion National Park, 
           the Grand Canyon, and other breathtaking destinations. I can't wait to hit the road
            again and discover more of the incredible sights this country has to offer.</p>
