                  <h2>Edge Assisted SLAM with Human-Construction
                    Collaborative Robot</h2>
                  <p>Accurate localization and mapping are key concerns
                    while deploying a robot to assist humans at an indoor construc-
                    tion site. Simultaneous localization and mapping are intense in
                    terms of memory and computation. Edge computing helps offload
                    some of the tasks of the mobile robot to an edge device. In this
                    paper, we test the EdgeSLAM algorithm for generating a map of
                    the second floor of Schorr Center at the University of Nebraska
                    Lincoln to ensure that it can be used at a construction site
                    building where the aim of the robot is to navigate to specific goals
                    while avoiding humans and maintaining a safe distance of 1.25
                    meters from the human workers at all points in time. Further, our
                    approach uses a YOLOv3 network to detect a human worker and
                    then performs clustering and Kalman filtering for point-cloud
                    data from a depth camera to estimate the relative human motion
                    under the robotâ€™s local coordination. The estimated human states
                    and their associating errors are used to monitor the potential
                    collision between the human and robot at runtime using the
                    rtamt tool</p>

                  <h2>Spanish News Classification</h2>
                  <p>This project focuses on text classification using a BERT-based model on a Spanish news dataset.
                     The dataset is preprocessed and split into training, validation, and test sets. 
                     The model architecture includes input layers for tokenized text and attention masks, 
                     followed by a BERT layer and a softmax output layer. The model is trained using TensorFlow with
                      Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss. Visualization techniques, such as training
                       and validation accuracy plots, training and validation loss plots, and a confusion matrix, 
                       are employed to analyze the model's performance.</p>

                  <h2>Markov Model for Voynich Manuscript</h2>
                  <p>Markov model of the Voynich Manuscript provides us with useful information for
                     analysing the Voynich script. We used the transition matrices generated by our
                      model to compare the six sections of the Manuscript, to compare the Manuscript
                       to several natural languages, and to calculate the most likely character for
                        several unknown characters in this transcription of the Voynich Manuscript.
                         We found that the Voynich Manuscript appears to have similar character distributions
                          throughout the different sections of the manuscript. Additionally, we found
                           that the Manuscript has several unique features such as a high number of high
                            probability character combinations and large number of character combinations
                             that never occur within the Manuscript. Based on the results of our comparison
                              to other languages we propose that one of more of the characters in those high
                               probability character combinations are vowel sounds and that the Voynich gallows
                                characters may indicate stress or some other element of paralinguistics. Lastly,
                                 we demonstrated how the Markov model can be used to create a more accurate and
                                  complete transcription of the manuscript through mathematical analysis of which
                                   character is the most probable for hard-to-read characters given the surrounding characters.

                  <h2>Vision Transformer</h2>
                  <p>This project centers on the re-
                    implementation of the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, a pivotal development in computer vision. ViT utilizes
                    self-attention mechanisms for image recognition, promising to
                    surpass conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
                    Challenges to be addressed include scaling ViT for larger
                    images and datasets while maintaining efficiency, devising
                    efficient pretraining strategies in data-limited scenarios,
                    optimizing fine-tuning techniques for specific tasks, and
                    enhancing interpretability. ViT is crucial due to its potential to
                    capture long-range dependencies in images, enabling broader
                    generalization beyond grid-like patterns. Anticipated outcomes
                    involve showcasing ViT's superiority in terms of accuracy,
                    efficiency, and adaptability, thereby advancing image recognition
                    technology in domains like healthcare and autonomous driving.
                    This re-implementation of ViT holds the potential to revolutionize
                    computer vision, delivering impactful solutions for a multitude
                    of applications.</p>

                       architectures for image classification using the CIFAR-100 dataset. The architectures
                        consist of convolutional layers with pooling and at least one fully connected layer,

                    <h2>Classifying Fashion MNIST</h2>
                    <p>This project explores the design and implementation of two architectures for image classification
                       using the Fashion MNIST dataset. The architectures consist of fully connected layers with ReLU activation
                        for hidden nodes and softmax for the output layer. TensorFlow is utilized for model implementation,
                         with data accessed via TensorFlow Datasets. Hyperparameter selection is conducted independently of
                          the test set, with validation data obtained through either a single training set and a single validation
                           set or k-fold cross-validation. The models are optimized using Adam, with at least two sets of hyperparameters
                            and one regularizer evaluated for each architecture. The results will provide insights into the performance
